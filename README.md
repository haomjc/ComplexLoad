Part of the code for "Load distribution and radial deformations for planetary roller screw mechanism with axial load, radial load and turning torque"

Obtaining the load distribution and radial deformations of planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) for the load carrying capacity design under complex loading conditions (multi-directional loads) is beneficial to decelerate fatigue and wear of threads. However, the combined effects of axial load, radial load and turning torque (overturning moment) were ignored in previous studies due to the complicated structure of PRSM. This paper presents a multi-roller beam-bar-spring (MR-BBS) model that incorporate radial load, turning torque and thread modification. The proposed model extended the theoretic method for calculating bending behavior of screw and rollers, which can more precisely describe the locus of the threads and roller axis. The load distribution of threads and load sharing among rollers of a PRSM under different external loads and cycling process are analyzed. The results show that the load distribution is more sensitive to turning torque of screw but relatively insensitive to the radial load. Moreover, the load distribution moderately changes with the variation of modification factor. Based on thread modification, the variable lead PRSM is proposed so that the uniformity of load sharing with complex load can be optimized.
